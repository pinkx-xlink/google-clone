## Today I am modernizing my Google Clone project to gauge my growth as a web developer over the past few years... and to gauge how much the Google homepage has changed!

One of my first priorities with this update was to make the search bar actually functional. Now with just a simple JavaScript function, when the user searches for "puppies," they will be redirected to Google images of puppies! (Or whatever else they choose to search.)

## Challenges

Google is constantly changing along with the world; the searchbar now sports different search options, from search by image, to AI Mode. Unlike the simple magnifying glass and Google's "G" icon, these newer icons weren't easy to find online, so I screenshotted the icons and edited them myself in Canva so that I can include these modern assets.

This repo was one of my first personal experiments with HTML and CSS outside of my curriculum.

I made this webpage while in between Javascript project assignments to flex my CSS muscles after shifting my focus away from CSS for a while.
It was a fun mini project and helped me strengthen my working knowledge of flex, input fields, hover effects, and implementing icons into a webpage.
